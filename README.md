		The project undertaken for this term is Fire Extinguishing System. This was done to extinguish fire automatically using the Arduino board and motor.
			
		The purpose of the system is to detect the fire through the flame sensor and send the message of fire to the cell phone of the owner of that store or house that there is a fire spread in your property. And simultaneously the shower starts to extinguish fire.

						Build Instructions


		Try to make correct connections with lights otherwise they will get fused. We got 07 lights fused during making this project.
 



							Usage
 
			The usage of this project is household and commercial purpose, to prevent fire injuries and chaos.
			Moreover it can be made at home for those people who live in far towns which don't have such a system.
 


 
							Team
        
			The build team consists of:
 
				*  VIRAJ PATEL , Did hardware and edit and upload video
				*  HARSH PATEL , Did coding and find resources
				*  PREM PATEL , He found and ordered everything from online with our suggestion, 
						moreover he did the project write-up and helped Viraj and harsh.
 
				*  Roommates - They helped us to give us a quiet place. Also they made food for us. 
						Also, They gave reviews about the project which was a great motivation for us to do 
						something new in future. They felt proud of themselves because of them.
 
 

 
							Credits

 
				*  Viral Science - get ideas from his different projects and try to combine that and do something new.
